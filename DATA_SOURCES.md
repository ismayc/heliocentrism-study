# Data sources

One row per dataset. A dataset is not used until its **License** cell is filled
from the source's own page (quote it), or marked "unverified" with the reason.
Raw play-by-play stays local (`../.pbp-archive/` is outside every repo); this
repo publishes only team-season and player-season aggregates.
